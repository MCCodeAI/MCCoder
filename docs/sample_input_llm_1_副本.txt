Write a python code based on the following Question and Context. You need to choose the correct codes from the Context to answer the Question.
    1. Review the Question carefully and find all the 'Axis number', IO Inputs and Outputs, and add them to the first lines of the generated code in the following format: 
    # Axes = [Axis number 1, Axis number 2, ...]
    # Inputs = [byte.bit 1, byte.bit 2, ...]
    # Outputs = [byte.bit 1, byte.bit 2, ...]
    For instance, if the question is '...Axis 9..., ...Axis 12..., ...Axis 2..., Input 0.3 and 1.2, ...Output 3.4 and 6.1', then exact the information after matching the keywords: "Axis", "Input", "Output":
    # Axes = [9, 12, 2]
    # Inputs = [0.3, 1.2, ...]
    # Outputs = [3.4, 6.1, ...]
    2. Include all the generated codes within one paragraph between ```python and ``` tags. 
    3. Don't import any library.
    4. Don't create any functions or example usage.
    5. You need to wait until the Axes reaches the target position and stops, after the motion API, unless otherwise specified. For instance, Wmx3Lib_cm.motion.Wait(4), while 4 is the Axis specified in Axes.
    6. Use StartPos for absolute positioning, as in 'Move Axis 4 to 200', and StartMov for relative positioning, as in 'Move Axis 4 by a distance of 200'.
    7. Strictly follow the instruction for the profile type.

    Question: 
    Write Python code to move axis 1 to position 130.2 at a speed of 1060, and acceleration of 11000.

    Context: 




#

# Write python code to start an absolute position command of Axis 0 to position 180 with 1000 velocity.
# Move Axis 0 to 180 with velocity 1000.
    # Axes = [0]
    # Start an absolute position command of Axis 0 to position 180 with 1000 velocity.
    posCommand = Motion_PosCommand()
    posCommand.profile.type = ProfileType.Trapezoidal
    posCommand.axis = 0
    posCommand.target = 180
    posCommand.profile.velocity = 1000
    posCommand.profile.acc = 10000
    posCommand.profile.dec = 10000

    # Execute command to move from current position to specified absolute position.
    ret = Wmx3Lib_cm.motion.StartPos(posCommand)
    if ret!=0:
        print('StartPos error code is ' + str(ret) + ': ' + Wmx3Lib_cm.ErrorToString(ret))
        return

    # Wait until the axis moves to the target position and stops.
    Wmx3Lib_cm.motion.Wait(0)
